Insecure Automated Optimizations - (1038),1145,10007107581038,"The product uses a mechanism that automatically optimizes code, e.g. to improve a characteristic such as performance, but the optimizations can have an unintended side effect that might violate an intended security assumption.",1000710758
Processor Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code - (1037),1146,100071075810381037,"The developer builds a security-critical protection mechanism into the software, but the processor optimizes the execution of the program such that the mechanism is removed or modified.",10007107581038
Compiler Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code - (733),1147,10007107581038733,"The developer builds a security-critical protection mechanism into the software, but the compiler optimizes the program such that the mechanism is removed or modified.",10007107581038
Compiler Removal of Code to Clear Buffers - (14),1148,1000710758103873314,"Sensitive memory is cleared according to the source code, but compiler optimizations leave the memory untouched when it is not read from again, aka ""dead store removal.""",10007107581038733
Reliance on Machine-Dependent Data Representation - (1102),1149,10007107581102,"The code uses a data representation that relies on low-level
					data representation or constructs that may vary across different processors,
					physical machines, OSes, or other physical components.",1000710758
Use of Platform-Dependent Third Party Components - (1103),1150,10007107581103,"The product relies on third-party software components that do
					not provide equivalent functionality across all desirable
					platforms.",1000710758
Insufficient Encapsulation of Machine-Dependent Functionality - (1105),1151,10007107581105,"The product or code uses machine-dependent functionality, but
					it does not sufficiently encapsulate or isolate this functionality from
					the rest of the code.",1000710758
Reliance on Data/Memory Layout - (188),1152,10007107581105188,"The software makes invalid assumptions about how protocol data or memory is organized at a lower level, resulting in unintended program behavior.",10007107581105
Use of Incorrect Byte Ordering - (198),1153,10007107581105188198,"The software receives input from an upstream component, but it does not account for byte ordering (e.g. big-endian and little-endian) when processing the input, causing an incorrect number or value to be used.",10007107581105188
Use of Function with Inconsistent Implementations - (474),1154,1000710758474,The code uses a function that has inconsistent implementations across operating systems and versions.,1000710758
Call to Non-ubiquitous API - (589),1155,1000710758474589,The software uses an API function that does not exist on all versions of the target platform. This could cause portability problems or inconsistencies that allow denial of service or other consequences.,1000710758474
Return of Stack Variable Address - (562),1156,1000710758562,"A function returns the address of a stack variable, which will cause unintended program behavior, typically in the form of a crash.",1000710758
Assignment of a Fixed Address to a Pointer - (587),1157,1000710758587,The software sets a pointer to a specific address other than NULL or 0.,1000710758
Attempt to Access Child of a Non-structure Pointer - (588),1158,1000710758588,Casting a non-structure type to a structure type and accessing a field can lead to memory access errors or data corruption.,1000710758
Hidden Functionality - (912),1159,1000710912,"The software contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the software's users or administrators.",1000710
